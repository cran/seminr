SEMinR allows users to easily create and modify structural equation
models (SEM). It allows estimation using either covariance-based SEM
(CBSEM, such as LISREL/Lavaan), or Partial Least Squares Path Modeling
(PLS-PM, such as SmartPLS/semPLS).

## First Look

Main features of using SEMinR:

  - A *natural* feeling, *domain-specific* language to build and
    estimate SEMs in R
  - *High-level functions* to quickly specify interactions and
    complicated structural models
  - *Modular design* of models that promotes reuse of model components
  - Encourages *best practices* by use of smart defaults and warnings

Take a look at the easy syntax and modular design:

``` r
# Define measurements with famliar terms: reflective, composite, multi-item constructs, etc.
measurements <- constructs(
  reflective("Image",       multi_items("IMAG", 1:5)),
  composite("Expectation", multi_items("CUEX", 1:3)),
  composite("Loyalty",     multi_items("CUSL", 1:3), weights = mode_B),
  composite("Complaints",  single_item("CUSCO"))
)

# Create four relationships (two regressions) in one line!
structure <- relationships(
  paths(from = c("Image", "Expectation"), to = c("Complaints", "Loyalty"))
)

# Estimate the model using PLS estimation scheme (Consistent PLS for reflectives)
pls_model <- estimate_pls(data = mobi, measurements, structure)
#> Generating the seminr model
#> All 250 observations are valid.

# Re-estimate the model as a purely reflective model using CBSEM
cbsem_model <- estimate_cbsem(data = mobi, as.reflective(measurements), structure)
#> Generating the seminr model for CBSEM
```

SEMinR can plot models using the semplot (for CBSEM models) or
DiagrammeR (for PLS models) packages with a simple `plot` method.

``` r
plot(pls_model, title = "PLS Model")
save_plot("myfigure.pdf")
```

SEMinR allows various estimation methods for constructs and SEMs:

  - Covariance-based Structural Equation Modeling (CBSEM)
      - *Covariance-based estimation* of SEM using the popular
        [Lavaan](https://github.com/yrosseel/lavaan) package
      - Currently supports mediation and moderation models with
        constructs
      - Easily *specify interactions* between constructs
      - Adds ten Berge *factor score extraction* to get same correlation
        patterns as latent factors
      - Adds *VIF* and other validity assessments
  - Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) using Lavaan
      - Uses [Lavaan](https://github.com/yrosseel/lavaan) package and
        returns results and syntax
      - Adds ten Berge *factor score extraction* to get same correlation
        patterns as latent factors
  - Partial Least Squares Path Modeling (PLS-PM)
      - Uses non-parametric *variance-based estimation* to construct
        *composites* and *common-factors*
      - Automatically *estimates using Consistent PLS (PLSc)* when
        emulating reflective common factors
      - Adjusts for known biases in interaction terms in PLS models
      - Continuously tested against leading PLS-PM software to ensure
        parity of outcomes: SmartPLS, ADANCO, semPLS, and matrixpls
      - *High performance, multi-core* bootstrapping function

Researchers can now create a SEM and estimate it using different
techniques (CBSEM, PLS-PM).

## Installation

You can install SEMinR from R with:

``` r
install.packages("seminr")
```

## Usage and Examples

Load the SEMinR package:

``` r
library(seminr)
```

Describe measurement and structural models and then estimate them. See
the various examples below for different use cases:

1.  [CFA + CBSEM Example with Common
    Factors](#cbsem--cfa-example-with-common-factors)
2.  [Consistent-PLS (PLSc) Example with Common
    Factors](#consistent-pls-plsc-example-with-common-factors)
3.  [PLS-PM Example with Composites](#pls-pm-example-with-composites)
4.  [Comparing CBSEM and PLS-PM
    Example](#comparing-cbsem-and-pls-pm-example)

### CFA + CBSEM Example with Common Factors

Note that CBSEM models reflective common-factor constructs, not
composites. SEMinR uses the powerful Lavaan package to estimate CBSEM
models â€“ you can even inspect the more complicated Lavaan syntax that is
produced.

Describe reflective constructs and interactions:

``` r
# Distinguish and mix composite or reflective (common-factor) measurement models
# - composite measurements will have to be converted into reflective ones for CBSEM (see below)
measurements <- constructs(
  reflective("Image",       multi_items("IMAG", 1:5)),
  reflective("Expectation", multi_items("CUEX", 1:3)),
  interaction_term(iv = "Image", moderator = "Expectation", method = two_stage),
  reflective("Loyalty",     multi_items("CUSL", 1:3)),
  reflective("Complaints",  single_item("CUSCO"))
)
```

Describe the causal relationships between constructs and interactions:

``` r
# Quickly create multiple paths "from" and "to" sets of constructs
structure <- relationships(
  paths(from = c("Image", "Expectation", "Image*Expectation"), to = "Loyalty"),
  paths(from = "Image", to = c("Complaints"))
)
```

Put the above elements together to estimate the model using Lavaan:

``` r
# Evaluate only the measurement model using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)
cfa_model <- estimate_cfa(data = mobi, measurements)
summary(cfa_model)

# Dynamically compose full SEM models from individual parts
# - if measurement model includes composites, convert all constructs to reflective using:
#     as.reflective(measurements)
cbsem_model <- estimate_cbsem(data = mobi, measurements, structure)
sum_cbsem_model <- summary(cbsem_model)
sum_cbsem_model$meta$syntax # See the Lavaan syntax if you wish
```

### Consistent-PLS (PLSc) Example with Common Factors

Models with reflective common-factor constructs can also be estimated in
PLS-PM, using Consistent-PLS (PLSc). Note that the popular SmartPLS
software models constructs as composites rather than common-factors
([see below](#pls-pm-example-with-composites)) but can also do PLSc as a
special option.

We will reuse the measurement and structural models from earlier:

``` r
# Optionally inspect the measuremnt and structural models
measurements
structure
```

Estimate full model using Consistent-PLS and bootstrap it for confidence
intervals:

``` r
# Models with reflective constructs are automatically estimated using PLSc
pls_model <- estimate_pls(data = mobi, measurements, structure)
summary(pls_model)

# Use multi-core parallel processing to speed up bootstraps
boot_estimates <- bootstrap_model(pls_model, nboot = 1000, cores = 2)
summary(boot_estimates)
```

### PLS-PM Example with Composites

PLS-PM typically models composites (constructs that are weighted average
of items) rather than common factors. Popular software like SmartPLS
models composites either as Mode A (correlation weights) or Mode B
(regression weights). We also support both modes as well as second-order
composites. rather than common factors. Popular software like SmartPLS
models composites by default, either as Mode A (correlation weights) or
Mode B (regression weights). We also support second-order composites.

Describe measurement model for each composite, interaction, or higher
order composite:

``` r
# Composites are Mode A (correlation) weighted by default
mobi_mm <- constructs(
  composite("Image",        multi_items("IMAG", 1:5)),
  composite("Value",        multi_items("PERV", 1:2)),
  higher_composite("Satisfaction", dimensions = c("Image","Value"), method = two_stage),
  composite("Expectation",  multi_items("CUEX", 1:3)),
  composite("Quality",      multi_items("PERQ", 1:7), weights = mode_B),
  composite("Complaints",   single_item("CUSCO")),
  composite("Loyalty",      multi_items("CUSL", 1:3), weights = mode_B)
)
```

Define a structural (inner) model for our PLS-PM:

``` r
mobi_sm <- relationships(
  paths(from = c("Expectation","Quality"),  to = "Satisfaction"),
  paths(from = "Satisfaction", to = c("Complaints", "Loyalty"))
)
```

Estimate full model using PLS-PM and bootstrap it for confidence
intervals:

``` r
pls_model <- estimate_pls(
  data = mobi,
  measurement_model = mobi_mm,
  structural_model = mobi_sm
)

summary(pls_model)

# Use multi-core parallel processing to speed up bootstraps
boot_estimates <- bootstrap_model(pls_model, nboot = 1000, cores = 2)
summary(boot_estimates)
```

### Plotting the model results

SEMinR can plot all supported models using the dot language and the
graphViz.js widget from the `DiagrammeR` package.

``` r
# generate a small model for creating the plot
mobi_mm <- constructs(
  composite("Image",        multi_items("IMAG", 1:3)),
  composite("Value",        multi_items("PERV", 1:2)),
  higher_composite("Satisfaction", dimensions = c("Image","Value"), method = two_stage),
  composite("Quality",      multi_items("PERQ", 1:3), weights = mode_B),
  composite("Complaints",   single_item("CUSCO")),
  reflective("Loyalty",      multi_items("CUSL", 1:3))
)
mobi_sm <- relationships(
  paths(from = c("Quality"),  to = "Satisfaction"),
  paths(from = "Satisfaction", to = c("Complaints", "Loyalty"))
)
pls_model <- estimate_pls(
  data = mobi,
  measurement_model = mobi_mm,
  structural_model = mobi_sm
)
#> Generating the seminr model
#> Generating the seminr model
#> All 250 observations are valid.
#> All 250 observations are valid.
boot_estimates <- bootstrap_model(pls_model, nboot = 100, cores = 1)
#> Bootstrapping model using seminr...
#> SEMinR Model successfully bootstrapped
```

When we have a model, we can plot it and save the plot to files.

``` r
plot(boot_estimates, title = "Bootstrapped Model")
save_plot("myfigure.pdf")
```

![](man/figures/model.png)

#### Themes

We can customize the plot using an elaborate theme. Themes can be used
for individual plots as a parameter or set as a default. Using the
`seminr_theme_create()` function allows to define different themes.

``` r
# Tip: auto complete is your friend in finding all possible themeing options.
thm <- seminr_theme_create(plot.rounding = 2, plot.adj = FALSE, 
                           sm.node.fill = "cadetblue1",
                           mm.node.fill = "lightgray")
# change new default theme - valid until R is restarted
seminr_theme_set(thm)

# the new plot
plot(boot_estimates)
```

### Comparing CBSEM and PLS-PM Example

We can re-estimate a composite PLS-PM model as a common-factor CBSEM.
Such a comparison might interest researchers seeking to evaluate how
their constructs behave when modeled as composites versus
common-factors.

``` r
# Define measurements with famliar terms: reflective, multi-item constructs, etc.
measurements <- constructs(
  composite("Image",       multi_items("IMAG", 1:5)),
  composite("Expectation", multi_items("CUEX", 1:3)),
  composite("Loyalty",     multi_items("CUSL", 1:3)),
  composite("Complaints",  single_item("CUSCO"))
)

# Create four relationships (two regressions) in one line!
structure <- relationships(
  paths(from = c("Image", "Expectation"), to = c("Complaints", "Loyalty"))
)

# First, estimate the model using PLS
pls_model <- estimate_pls(data = mobi, measurements, structure)

# Reusable parts of the model to estimate CBSEM results
# note: we are using the `as.reflective()` function to convert composites to common factors
cbsem_model <- estimate_cbsem(data = mobi, as.reflective(measurements), structure)

# Re-estimate the model using common factors in Consistent PLS (PLSc)
pls_model <- estimate_pls(data = mobi, as.reflective(measurements), structure)
```
